In shadows cast by life's fleeting flame,  
Where whispers of mortality proclaim,  
Behold the heart's eternal yearning cry,  
In depths where mortal coils do lie.  
  
In twilight's dance, where time's cruel jest,  
We find our souls, by fate's behest,  
Bound by threads of destiny's design,  
In this mortal coil, we intertwine.  
  
For what are we but dust and air,  
A fleeting breath, a moment's flare,  
Yet in our depths, a fire does burn,  
A spark of divinity, a lesson to learn.  
  
So let us seize this transient hour,  
Embrace the beauty, feel its power,  
For in the dance of life's refrain,  
We find our solace, our joy, our pain.  
  
Though shadows lengthen, and darkness nears,  
Let not our hearts be consumed by fears,  
For in the echoes of eternity's call,  
We find our peace, our purpose, our all.
