## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,  
   As he landed his crew with care;  
Supporting each man on the top of the tide  
   By a finger entwined in his hair.  
  
Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:  
   That alone should encourage the crew.  
Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:  
   What I tell you three times is true."  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

I have been one acquainted with the night.  
I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.  
I have outwalked the furthest city light.  
  
I have looked down the saddest city lane.  
I have passed by the watchman on his beat  
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  
  
The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —  
It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In shadows cast by life's fleeting flame,  
Where whispers of mortality proclaim,  
Behold the heart's eternal yearning cry,  
In depths where mortal coils do lie.  
  
In twilight's dance, where time's cruel jest,  
We find our souls, by fate's behest,  
Bound by threads of destiny's design,  
In this mortal coil, we intertwine.  
  
For what are we but dust and air,  
A fleeting breath, a moment's flare,  
Yet in our depths, a fire does burn,  
A spark of divinity, a lesson to learn.  
  
So let us seize this transient hour,  
Embrace the beauty, feel its power,  
For in the dance of life's refrain,  
We find our solace, our joy, our pain.  
  
Though shadows lengthen, and darkness nears,  
Let not our hearts be consumed by fears,  
For in the echoes of eternity's call,  
We find our peace, our purpose, our all.
